**Harkey et al. 2019**

This repository is intended as a complement to an article curently in review at Frontiers in Plant Science titled **Light modulates ethylene synthesis, signaling, and downstream transcriptional networks to control plant development.**

The overall purpose of this article was to review the interaction of light signaling and ethylene in plants. To this end, we performed two analyses of publically available transcriptional datasets:

* **Das2016 analysis:** Used data from plants treated with shade or with ethylene under otherwise identical conditions to compare and contrast the effect of these two treatments
* **RootOverlap analysis:** Used data from three different root datasets which used ethylene (or ACC, the ethylene precursor) treatment in light- or dark-grown plants, to compare and contrast the effects of ethylene under these conditions

These analyses were both performed in R using the limma package.
